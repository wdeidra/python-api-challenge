# Python API Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, I used Python to interact with APIs to gather, process, and visualize data. I demonstrated how to programmatically retrieve information from web services and turn it into actionable insights.

## Objectives
1. **API Integration**:
   - Use APIs (like OpenWeatherMap or Google Maps) to gather data.
   - Parse JSON responses to extract relevant information.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze the collected data to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create maps, charts, or other visualizations to present your findings effectively.
4. **Key Insights**:
   - Draw conclusions based on the analysis and visualize findings in a clear and engaging manner.

## Deliverables
- Python scripts for interacting with APIs and processing responses.
- Visualizations showcasing data trends and insights.
- A summary of findings derived from the analysis.
